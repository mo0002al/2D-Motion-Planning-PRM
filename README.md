# Probabilistic Roadmap Path Planning in 2D Environment

This repository contains an implementation of a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm for path planning in a 2D environment. The code leverages NetworkX for graph-based operations, KDTree from Scikit-learn for efficient nearest-neighbor searches, and Pylab for visualization.
